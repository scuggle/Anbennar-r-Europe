 X01_ideas_bonus:0 "Gerudian Empire Ambition"
 X01_one:0 "Legacy of the Clans"
 X01_one_desc:0 "In olden times the ruler of a clan would be decided by battle. While this tradition has been a thing of the past we Gerudians still value strength of both body and mind, as well as an inclination to military matters. This is reflected in our rulers as well."
 X01_two:0 "A Reavers Life"
 X01_two_desc:0 "The life of a reaver is embedded deeply into our hearts and culture. To go out to sea, to plunder for slaves and treasure is as natural to us as breathing."
 X01_three:0 "Hardened by the frost"
 X01_three_desc:0 "The winters in Gerudia are cold and tough. It takes a certain type of hardyness and bodily strength that the southerners lack to survive in the cold north. This strong breed of people will not back down in the face of ice and frost, nor to a wound."
 X01_four:0 "The Thing of war"
 X01_four_desc:0 "While our administration is as modern as they come we do not forfeit our traditions. Once every year, at the eve of winter solstice, the leaders of the Gerudian clans meet for the great Thing. Matters of war and battle are discussed and the cheiftains compete, as much with words and strategies as with strength and blade. Whoever sets themself apart are appointed to advise the High King in matters of war."
 X01_five:0 "People of the sea"
 X01_five_desc:0 "We are a seafaring people though and through. While the great longboats are a thing of the past we still heavily rely on ships and boats to connect our Empire. Many a Gerudian has spent part of their lives on a ship, still as many have gone to war on one."
 X01_six:0 "Work or die"
 X01_six_desc:0 "You have no time to slack off in Gerudia. When the winter comes you had better been prepared, unless you want to freeze or starve to death. When the alternative is death, one tends to prefer to work hard."
 X01_seven:0 "Blood of Giants"
 X01_seven_desc:0 "The southerners often claim that Gerudians have inherited the blood of giants, that we are as related to trolls as to other men. While this is obviously untrue us Gerudians grow tall and broad and strong of body. When met in a melee the southerners are quickly dispatched by superior Gerudian strength and blade."

They are a great success, even having received honorary titles from the humans. Surely 'Clown' is a title of great honor."
 X12_four:0 "A shared interest"
 X12_four_desc:0 "It's a wonderful thing to have so many humans around us. While we try to emulate them as best as we can we also need to accept that we are still different from them. We simply ensure that we respect their customs and way of life as much - no. More. - than even our own."

 X15_three:0 "Flexible building codes"

However during war times there are lots of sturdy, immobile targets to try our ideas on. Any time we siege a fortress we have an event called 'Festival of Explosionism' where any Goblin can try their new bomb, missile or whatever on the fortifications. It's a lot of fun and demoralizes the enemy."

 X19_five:0 "The Bal Mire Waterways"
 X19_five_desc:0 "Bal Mire is a fettered swamp with only one redeeming quality, almost all rivers in escann flow into this wetland, creating vast waterways for the trade ships of Escann to sail on. We shall exploit this by investing in waterways and canals, and making those in eastern Escann pay for it!"
 X19_six:0 "Airgethil is for Elves"
 X19_six_desc:0 "We in Airgethil will always accept some races into the fold, but we want those who live in our lands to know it is a home for elves first, for them second and for some of them, third. We will not hesitate in times of hardship to blame troubles on the minorities of our realm and we promote this idea by almost exclusively hiring those of pure elvish stock."
 X19_seven:0 "Light Step Across The Land"
 X19_seven_desc:0 "As our military grows, the logistics of our soldier’s coordination becomes harder to manage on the vast stretches of territory within and without our domain.

This is a new undertaking for us, should anything terrible happen on the waves, we can at least rely on our wings to ferry provisions back from the mainland. "
 X20_two:0 "A Soft Whip"
 X20_two_desc:0 "With the influx of slaves we drag in every month, many are not deemed suitable by the upper elites of Falahen to mate with. Although those of lesser stock are not picky and those mates ill suited would rather be consorts than physical labour, we have come to a compromise. To keep both groups in line, we shall extend mating rights to those slaves who perform well in their given role. Those harpies wishing to have a mate may pick from a handful of candidates before the slaves are taken back, after successfully mating of course."
 X20_three:0 "Consorts of Falahen"
 X20_three_desc:0 "The Falahen Royal family takes its name sake from the Regent Court Deity, Falah, an influence from the teachings of Crathanor preachers kidnapped by our ancestors.

"
 X20_four:0 "Black Sails and Black Wings"
 X20_four_desc:0 "Privateering invokes the idea of unwashed simpletons looting and pillaging the ships and coasts of others, killing and plundering anything that crosses their path.

 X20_five:0 "On the Sunset Sea"
 X20_five_desc:0 "Our sisters have learned the way of oceans, but troubles have begun to arise, many of the Cannorians and Bulwari have begun to use heavily gunned warships in place of the old Carrack designs. Although we may at times struggle to match the raw power of these vessels, we can at least turn the tide in both our manoeuvrability of our fleets and the use of our wings to directly firebomb them from above, causing chaos and pandemonium in their ranks."
 X20_six:0 "Black Winged Warriors and White Cloaked Consorts"
 X20_six_desc:0 "Due to our ability to fly we are able to easily support our sisters and slaves both out at sea and on land, flying in low to drop bombs and directly land trusted consort marines. Although we may never have trusted our Consorts on the front line previously, for they are too precious to lose, our warriors demand that their consorts join them in battle. This phenomenon has allowed both ground and air forces to work in tandem with one another, reducing casualties immensely. This however has had another phenomenon, due to our sisters only being able to carry one mate in their talons to the battlefield, many have opted to forgo multiple consorts and instead only have one mate, insisting that it allows for greater teamwork and stronger offspring. "
 X20_seven:0 "Consort Legions"
 X20_seven_desc:0 "We have finally done away with the concept of slave armies, seeing the effectiveness of the Black Wings and the White Cloaks, we have decided to reform our armed forces to incorporate our consorts onto the battlefield. Although we thought there would be some push back, our warriors have gleefully supported the idea of fighting alongside their mates in battle. This in turn has encouraged many of the potential mates in our domain not in slavery to sign up, with the prospect of being considered a potential mate to our warriors in the future."

 B46_three:0 "Envious neighbors"
 B46_three_desc:0 "Many have tried to copy us and ride giant grasshoppers, less have survived the attempt. It is a matter of pride and proof of our superiority that only we have successfully ridden these beasts into battle - a fact that even our enemies have to begrudgringly acknowledge."
 B46_four:0 "Caravan Support"
