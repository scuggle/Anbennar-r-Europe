flavor_wex.1.t:0 "The Sack of Anbenncóst"
flavor_wex.1.d:0 "At the very end of the Lilac Wars in 1443 the Wexonard army besieged and sacked the imperial capital of Anbenncóst in order to defeat the late Grand Duke of Dameria, Adénn "Skylance".\n\nThe Wexonard army remained for several months after the war's end, looting and pillaging to their hearts content. It is said that even during the coronation of Grand Duke of Wex, Lothane, into the imperial throne of Anbennar, that the city was still a victim to Wexonard greed."
flavor_wex.1.a:0 "The city will take years to recover..."
flavor_wex.2.t:0 "Administrating Dameria"
flavor_wex.2.d:0 "Although Dameria was dismantled at the end of the Lilac Wars, its people still have not fully submitted to Wexonard rule. Small rebellions are causing waves, and with the fragmentation of Wex, it won't be long before the people rise up and Wex is embroiled in a civil conflict. Something must be done, and quickly..."
flavor_wex.2.a:0 "Grant the conquered lands autonomy under local Rose Party nobles."
flavor_wex.2.b:0 "Crush the rebellions; stamp out all resistance."
flavor_wex.3.t:0 "Lothane síl Wex: At the Precipice"
flavor_wex.3.d:0 "It is from a mountain's peak that one sees the clearest. Over the past four decades, Lothane síl Wex has brought his duchy to its very apex. With clever tongue, with a mighty blade, with powerful magic. By seeing what ideals like 'duty' and 'fealty' demanded of him — and spitting in their face while he stole their purse. Whatever the price, he has paid it, all to see Wex ascend. And from that vantage point, what does he see?\n\nThe same truth he has known all his life: Wex must rule.\n\nNot for the sake of power alone. Not for the sake of ambition or greed. For the Grand Duchy's survival, Wex must rule.\n\nFor Lothane síl Wex knows, and knows well: if Wex does not rule, Wex shall not be. He has been taught this from birth, an Alenic surrounded by a sea of Anbennarians. Perhaps in the past they could claw out a space of their own, though Lothane knows well how Dameria was slowly chipping away at that. But the Wexonards only came to Anbennar because a rival tribe, the filthy Gawedi, expelled them from the Alen, and the same could happen here. Will happen here, if those dogs in Istralore or Moonhaven rise, or if the traitors Lothane led against the Moon Throne turn face once more.\n\nLothane can see well the rising tide of revenge and revanchism, that would sweep him from the Empire of Anbennar's throne and bury his realm underneath. That would take all his clever deeds and bold decisions and turn them into ash. But as long as he stands, he is Wex's mighty sword, clever dagger, stalwart shield. He knows that Wex must rule, and he shall make it so."
flavor_wex.3.a:0 "Wex must rule."
flavor_wex.4.t:0 "Elf Elector Transfer War"
flavor_wex.4.d:0 "The elves of Moonhaven are not only the center of elven influence on Cannor, they are some of the most firm supporters of the Moon Party and Dameria generally. We must remove their influence if we are to maintain control of the Empire, yet we cannot openly deny the elves their electoral seat. An opportunity presents itself; offer the electorate to the kingdom of Ibevar, the most isolationist and thus tolerable of elves, in exchange for their support against the supporters of the Silmuna."

flavor_wex.5.t:0 "East Dameshead Elector Transfer War"
flavor_wex.5.d:0 "Istralore is Dameria's attack dog, we will never truly control the Empire while they remain an Elector. The dukes of Cestirande would make for far more loyal representatives of the East Dameshead, so let us make them an offer."

flavor_wex.9.t:0 "Cela síl Plumwall"
flavor_wex.9.d:0 "The first thing [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] notices when being presented with Cela síl Plumwall is her beauty. Flowing brown curls with streaks of purple and red frame an angelic face, while her piercing blue eyes catch the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s and hold them fixed. The Damerian farmlands are known for producing beautiful fruit, but she bears much more than plums, and far outpaces their charm.\n\nThe second thing [Root.Monarch.GetName] notices is the distinctive smell of Diohúis brandy wafting gently over from where she stands, curtsied. It only grows stronger as she rises and makes her introduction in a melodic voice, presenting herself to the assembled court and entreatingly requesting a place amidst it. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continues to stare, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cannot help but wonder whether it might be something else than blush that makes her cheeks glow so rosily, her smile spread so languorously. And then, of course, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] keen eyes notice the small silver flask tucked away in the folds of her Esmari dress.\n\nThis woman is... intoxicating in more ways than one, even if she is intoxicated, and already the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] feels [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head set spinning by her presence. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] maintains enough sobriety to make a decision: can this woman stay? And if so, how close should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] keep her?"
flavor_wex.9.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] would love to share a cup of Diohuis with her. In his bed-chambers, tonight?"
flavor_wex.9.b:0 "Give her brandy aplenty, and set her loose with foreign diplomats!"
flavor_wex.9.c:0 "I may be intoxicated, but I know enough to say this: tell the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] to pack her bags!"
flavor_wex.9.e:0 "Send her back to Plumwall, lest she distract and drunken us all."
flavor_wex.10.t:0 "Ivrandil Saltsworn"
flavor_wex.10.d:0 "Not all the moon elves of Varivar were loyal Damerian subjects. Indeed, not all the moon elves of Varivar even spent the bulk of their lives on the Damesear. Or so [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has surmised from an hour of conversation with the recently-returned-to-port captain Ivrandil Saltsworn.\n\nThe elf is tanned much darker than most Moon Elves, almost appearing as a Sun Elf at first glance. He is as garrulous as most are poised, quick to share a story or a laugh. And he seems to have little sense of who the nominal ruler of Varivar is, and to care even less.\n\nHe apparently makes most of his living taking on the occasional transport of hazardous materials around the Divenhal, and in trading with Sea Elves — who [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought were merely rumor, but who Saltsworn seems to have broken bread with and (as he says with a laugh) even almost married one!\n\nHe is amenable enough to flying the Wex flag under his Varivari one, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has another proposition in store: what would he say to a refitted ship, in exchange for assisting the Imperial Navy in his downtime?"
flavor_wex.10.a:0 "Request he advises the Admiralty."
flavor_wex.10.b:0 "Give him a proper warship and have him lead our fleet!"
flavor_wex.11.t:0 "Godric síl Acromton"
flavor_wex.11.d:0 "There is no zealot like a convert. Once, Godric síl Acromton was a Rubenairey lieutenant, whose brigade made the conquest of Acromton one of the Fourth Lilac War's more bloody affairs, fighting on long after Rubenaire switched signs and Acromton did too. He was captured but not killed, and spent a long stint in the prisons of Wexkeep. [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] would have been content to keep him there until he expired, but as part of the gentle hand [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] took towards the region, he was recently released under strict supervision and bound to the duchy's land.\n\nApparently, as a free man he decided to walk every inch of the duchy, to see the land he loved so dear and had been so long apart from. What he saw astounded him — the land and people prospering and flourishing, as they had never done under the distant eyes of their Rubenairey overlords, who (Godric would attest) cared more about their next vintage than the totality of their East Damesear holdings. By the end of his journey across the land, he had become a fierce believer in the value of Wexonard rule in the region. He even challenged a man making disparaging comments about Lothane síl Wex's parentage to a duel, punishing the rudeness and insubordination with a deep scar across the man's face.\n\nUpon hearing this news, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors were quick to suggest his geas be lifted, and he be allowed to leave Acromton to serve in the armies of Wex. Síl Acromton's newfound zealousness certainly brought a smile to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face, but it his decision on whether this once-enemy should be allowed a place of honour in the armies he long fought against."
